## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arnobt78/RestaurantJS--TailwindCSS-Fundamental-Project-5.git
   cd RestaurantJS--TailwindCSS-Fundamental-Project-5
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**  
   Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.  
   Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

   **Install specific packages (if not auto-installed):**
   ```bash
   npm i framer-motion date-fns react-leaflet lucide-react react-day-picker react-scroll react-icons react-responsive tailwindcss-animate
   ```

---

## Running the Project

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

You can start editing the main page by modifying `app/page.js`. The app supports hot reloading for rapid development.

---

## API & Routing

This project is a static front-end site and does not connect to a backend API by default.  
Next.js routing is file-based; each file in the `app/` directory corresponds to a route:

- `/` â†’ `app/page.js` (Homepage)
- Additional pages/components can be added under `app/` or as dynamic segments.

If you wish to add an API or server-side logic, refer to the [Next.js API Routes documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes).

## Component Walkthrough

- **Header & Navigation:** Responsive site header, mobile-friendly nav using Tailwind's utilities
- **Hero Section:** Eye-catching introduction with animations (Framer Motion)
- **Menu Display:** Showcases featured dishes or menu categories using card components
- **Reservation:** Date selection with React-Day-Picker and date-fns
- **Location/Map:** Interactive map using React-Leaflet for showing restaurant location
- **Contact Section:** Clean, accessible form for user inquiries
- **Footer:** Social links, copyright

All components are modular and reusable.  
Example (simplified):
```jsx
// components/Hero.jsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";
export default function Hero() {
  return (
    <motion.section initial={{ opacity: 0 }} animate={{ opacity: 1 }}>
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">Welcome to RestaurantJS</h1>
      <p className="mt-4">Experience modern dining with us!</p>
    </motion.section>
  );
}
```
